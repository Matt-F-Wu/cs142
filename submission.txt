Brief description to see the story in action: If you haven't liked a photo, clicking the like button and you will see the like count goes up by 1, as well as "*You liked this photo"! Now the button will change to UNLIKE, and clicking it will remove your like.

Is it OK with you if we post your Marketing Video URL on the class discussion forum? Yes

Any special instructions for Grading (should be easy to run app from new machine): Not really, I removed the images and node_modules tho. And mentio.js, which is an external library I downloaded caused some jshint error (becaused I downloaded a mini version, and it's not in node_modules).
